### Introduction

The Seat Reservation Management System is a user-friendly Windows Forms application designed to streamline the process of booking and managing seat reservations. This application presents a visual grid layout, allowing users to easily view seat availability in real-time. Users can perform essential functions such as booking a seat, canceling an existing reservation, and clearing all reservations with a few simple clicks.

In addition to managing direct seat bookings, the system efficiently handles a waitlist for situations where all seats are fully booked. When a seat becomes available due to a cancellation, the system automatically assigns the seat to the next person on the waitlist, ensuring a smooth and fair allocation of seating.

This application is ideal for venues, events, or any scenario where seat management is required, providing a seamless experience for both administrators and users.
